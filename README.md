# Futuristic Energy Portfolio

A small interactive frontend built with Vite, React and TypeScript that visualizes different sustainable energy concepts and activities.

This repository contains the source code and assets for the app along with a minimal development setup.

## Features

- Interactive diagrams for wind, biomass and geothermal energy
- Responsive sidebar and content components
- Built with modern React and Vite for a quick developer experience

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or any compatible package manager

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Start the development server

   npm run dev

3. Open the app in your browser

   The dev server output will list a local URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Build and preview

Build a production bundle:

   npm run build

Preview the production build locally:

   npm run preview

## Project structure

Key files and folders:

- `index.html` — app entry HTML
- `index.tsx`, `App.tsx` — React entry files
- `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json` — build and TypeScript config
- `components/` — React components (diagrams, sidebar, content, icons)
- `constants.ts`, `types.ts` — shared constants and TypeScript types

## Development notes

- The project uses Vite for fast hot module replacement during development.
- Keep dependencies up to date and run the build step before deploying.
